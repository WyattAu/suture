# Changelog

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

#### Formal Patch Algebra (Core Theory)
- **Patch composition** (`patch/compose.rs`): `compose()` collapses two patches into one equivalent operation; `compose_chain()` handles sequences
- **THM-COMPOSE-001**: Composed patch preserves union of touch sets; parent chain collapses
- **DEF-COMPOSE-001**: Formal definition — apply(P₃, pre_P₁) = apply(P₂, apply(P₁, pre_P₁))
- 8 composition tests (linear chain, disjoint/overlapping touch sets, chain, error cases)

#### Conflict Classification (Core Theory)
- **`ConflictClass`** enum: `AutoResolvable` (identical changes), `DriverResolvable` (different sub-addresses), `Genuine` (same element, different values), `Structural` (operation type mismatch)
- **`Conflict::classify()`** method: inspects patch payloads to determine conflict severity
- **`TouchSet::union()`** and **`TouchSet::subtract()`**: set-theoretic operations on touch sets
- 9 new tests (classification: 5, touch set operations: 4)

#### `suture squash` (Path A — Git Parity)
- `Repository::squash(count, message)` — composes last N patches into one

- `suture log --all` — shows commits across ALL branches, deduplicated, sorted by timestamp
- Collects from all branch tips via `dag().patch_chain()`
- Graph mode auto-disabled with `--all`

#### `log --since/--until` (Path A — Git Parity)
- `suture log --since "3 days ago"` — show commits newer than threshold
- `suture log --until "2026-01-15"` — show commits older than threshold
- Supports ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD) and relative times (N seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks/months/years ago)

#### CSV Semantic Merge (Path B — Semantic Differentiator)
- `CsvDriver::merge()` — three-way merge for CSV files
- Header union: columns added by either side are included
- Cell-by-cell conflict detection: same-index, different-value = conflict
- 4 tests: no-conflict, conflict, added rows, header change

#### OTIO Element ID Fix (Path B — Semantic Differentiator)
- Fixed element ID collision: `element_id()` now includes index and name (`{index}:{type}:{name}`)
- Multiple clips/tracks of same type get unique IDs
